# How to Contribute

First off, thank you so much for deciding to contribute.
I still have a lot of learning left to do in development and as this is my first project,
I'm excited to receive critique and feedback of my work.

## Issues/Suggestions/Pull Request Instructions

### Issue

Found an issue? Feel free to check in the issues tab and see if it has already been reported.

- If an issue exists, see if you can provide more info that isn't brought up yet!
- Otherwise, create a new issue and I'll try and get to it as soon as I can
- For convenience, do tag your issue using the labels provided
- The two required types of tags for issues are [bug | optimisation | question] and [behaviour | ui/ux | typo/clarification | documentation]
- Good tagging helps me prioritise my focus better

### Suggestion

Have a suggestion? You can treat it the same as an issue and follow the same steps as above

- For suggestions, these should be tagged under [optimisation | feature-request] and [behaviour | ui/ux | typo/clarification | qol]
- Suggestions will be considered, and will be closed if either completed/denied

### Pull Requests

You can make pull requests to suggest code changes directly.
I will get around to it and test them when I can, and if merged, will be credited to you in the changelogs and credits section.

- Pull requests can be made and tagged the same as either issue/suggestion with extra tags for PR state such as [wip | ready to pull | help wanted].
- Refrain from making pull requests to main
- Ideally, PRs should be made to dev branch or to hotfix branch, depending on the type of change you want to make
- Hotfix branch is synced to main and for making immediate changes that need to be addressed (Game Patch parity, urgent bugs, etc.)
- Dev branch is for everything else
- PRs to other branches are okay/welcome, as long as it is relevant to what those branches are for

## Things I need help with

### Code Improvements

A lot of the planner was written with me prioritising releasing changes/additions with the intent to optimise later.
This proved to be a less than ideal decision. As such I'm looking for people who can help break the files into smaller pieces,
which will hopefully make the planner easier to maintain/modify in the future

### Behavioural Parity

Due to various reasons, I have not played the game in a while and cannot do my own field research.
Any contributions that can make the planner match in-game behaviour better is welcome and under heavy consideration

### QoL Improvements

Any way to improve the experience of using the planner is highly welcome,
and a section of the project that I would greatly appreciate as it allows me to focus on the major changes/free up time

### Feature Additions

The main roadmap involves things that I have plans for.
Pull requests that does the same thing will be considered,
but may be declined if I prefer the approach I had in mind.
This is not to discourage you from making those additions yourselves, but a warning that your efforts might not be properly rewarded.

Anything else though is still welcome, and is unlikely to have conflicts with my own changes.
