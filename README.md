## Why is this called Palia Tools?

There's current plans to add other tools once the planner is considered feature-complete, with everything on the Road Map being ticked off.
Alternatively I may start work on them as a trial attempt or to work on something else for a bit.
What these tools are will depend on the current situation of community-made tools by the time the Garden Planner is at version 1.0.
